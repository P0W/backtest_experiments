## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Development Environment
- This is a **uv project** - use `uv` for all Python package management and execution
- **DO NOT** use `pip`, `conda`, `pipenv`, or any other package managers unless explicitly requested
- All commands should use `uv run` for Python execution (e.g., `uv run python script.py`)
- Package dependencies are managed via `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`

### Testing and Artifacts Policy
- **DO NOT** create additional test files or artifacts for verification unless explicitly requested
- If test files are created for debugging/verification purposes, **ALWAYS remove them** after completion
- Keep the workspace clean and maintain only the core project files
- Focus on enhancing existing code rather than creating temporary testing scaffolding
- Use inline testing or direct verification within existing files when possible

### Code Execution Guidelines
- Always use `uv run` prefix for Python commands
- Respect the existing project structure and file organization
- Maintain consistency with the established codebase patterns
- Ensure all changes integrate seamlessly with the existing backtesting framework
